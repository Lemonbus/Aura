# Aura

This is part of a batch of projects I made available to the public because they are no longer in active development, and/or are too unfinished or broken to be considered useful to me.

Aura in particular barely went anywhere, it was going to be an attempt at making an anticheat for Minecraft servers, however, I never even finished designing any of the framework.

Use this how you see fit.
